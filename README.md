# inputstream.adaptive
inputstream.adaptive kodi on LG webOS 

inputstream.adaptive for Kodi 21.0-ALPHA3, Copiled for LG webOS.

`It is not installed by Kodi via .ZIP as usual, but must be copied manually to TV`.

Unzip the inputstream.adaptive.zip and copy the folder inputstream.adaptive to `/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.xbmc.kodi/addons/` on the TV using FileZilla. 

Have fun with it.
